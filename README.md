# Challenge6-Weather-Dashboard

This project is designed to help practice new skills learned from third party APIs building a weather dashboard. I struggled with fetching the API data from the weather app, but I did make a good attempt at building the html front end, and attempt at creating the javascript back end. Still got a lot to learn!
